# Color-Vault-Anti-Aids
Omission of costumes (taken from the public modpack SSF2 Color Vault) that do not blend well with the background of the game, centralize glow as the main attraction of the costume or just look out of place (e.g. invisible costumes, meme costumes, random colors splashed together, etc..)

No offense intended towards users that have created the aforementioned costumes.

# How to install (for the uninitiated)

Read this section if somehow you messed up, even though the installation process is literally just replacing the files over whatever you currently have.


### Download the files from the release section

### Unzip the zip file using your preferred file extraction software to your "SSF2 XP Costumes" folder

It should be located in C:\Users\[user name]\Documents\SSF2 XP Costumes by default

#### If asked, agree to overwrite the files in the folder.
