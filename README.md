# Color-Vault-Anti-Aids
Omission of costumes (taken from the public modpack SSF2 Color Vault) that do not blend well with the background of the game, centralize glow as the main attraction of the costume or just look out of place (e.g. invisible costumes, meme costumes, random colors splashed together, etc..)

No offense intended towards users that have created the aforementioned costumes.

# How to install
WIP.
